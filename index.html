              </h1>

              <h3 class="mb-6">INTRODUCTION </h3>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">F</span>emale genital mutilation is a cultural practices that involves the partial or total removal of the
                female person’s external genital organ(s) or even causing injury to the female genitalia; including the
                performing of harmful procedures. </p>
              <p>According to the World Health Organization, this practice exists for non-medical reasons. The cut can
                be aimed at removing the <b>clitoris</b> (clitoridectomy), the <b>labia minora</b> and also,
                <b>infibulation</b> (which is
                basically the narrowing of the vaginal orifice with the creation of a covering seal by cutting and
                appositioning the labia minora with or without the excision of the clitoris).
              </p>
              <p>The extraction or rather "the cut" is usually on a basis of varying reasons. Oftentimes, it is a way
                for some communities to establish a woman's social viability thus it is a rite of passage within some
                communities whereas for other communities it is a way of defining "womanhood"- so that one can be termed
                a woman within that community. Other reasons include: amplifying one's viability for marriage, sexual
                maturity, hygiene and even for the purpose of aesthetics. </p>

              <p>Female genital mutilation is recognized as a form of violence against women; including the girl child.
                It is also recognized as a violation of human rights by the <b>1993 Declaration on Elimination of
                  Violence
                  against Women</b>. This being the case, the UN General Assembly went ahead to set aside <b>February
                  6th</b> as an
                <b>International Day for Zero Tolerance of Female Genital Mutilation</b>. Kenya being a party to the
                convention
                and having ratified it thus recognizes this day.
              </p>
              <!-- <p>Corporal punishment, which has been the result of litigation between parents and schools in some cases
                where it had resulted in fatal consequences, was liberally defined. It amounts to use of any physical
                force with intent to inflict pain or discomfort on a child for purposes of corrective discipline or
                punishment. This means that the weight of future arguments before the courts on reasonable use of
                physical force to discipline children has been incredibly watered down, and the consequences will cut
                across parents and teachers alike.</p> -->

              <p>Sessional Paper No. 3 of 2019 on the National Policy for the Eradication of Female Genital Mutilation
                as well as the National Policy on Gender Based Violence- 2019, give proper guidance on the monitoring,
                regulation as well as management of Female Genital Mutilation within the Country. </p>

              <h3 class="mb-6">STATUTORY DEVELOPMENT</h3>
              <p>The earliest Kenyan Statute to outlaw Female Genital Mutilation is <b>the Children Act No 8 of
                  2001</b>.
                However, the term Female Genital Mutilation was switched with Female Circumcision . This seemingly
                innocent interchange of words is key to understanding the position of FGM practice in Kenya at that
                time. </p>
              <p>The term Female Circumcision was used to draw a likeness to male circumcision, a scenario that hugely
                downplayed the distinct nature of the two procedures and the resulting consequences in both cases, as
                will be highlighted later in this article.</p>
              <p>The definition of female circumcision under the Children Act No 8 of 2001 was also wanting for its
                narrow constitution. It define it as follows: </p>
              <p><i>The cutting and removal of part or all of the female genitalia and includes the practices of
                  clitoridectomy, excision, infibulation or other practice involving the removal of part, or of the
                  entire clitoris or labia minora of a female person .</i></p>
              <p>Beyond these, superficial provisions the Act made no other substantial reference to Female Genital
                Mutilation other than acknowledging its status as an harmful cultural pressure practice. </p>
              <p>The <b>Constitution of Kenya 2010</b>, elevated the issue of children rights to a constitutional status
                through Article 53 of the Constitution. <b>Article 53 (1)(d)</b> in particular as read with <b> Section
                  14 of the
                  repealed 2001 Children Act</b>, provided that children should be protected from inter alias, harmful
                cultural practices such as Female Circumcision. </p>
              <p>The Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act No 32 of 2011, was the tipping point in the legal
                fight against FGM. The rationale for the enactment of the Act was to prohibit FGM and protect the mental
                and physical health of those it was likely to be performed on .
              </p>
              <p>The Act finally adopted the proper terminology and defined FGM as:</p>
              <p><i>all procedures involving partial or total removal of the female genitalia or other injury to the
                  female genital organs, or any harmful procedure to the female genitalia, for non-medical reasons, and
                  includes— (a) clitoridectomy… b) excision… c) infibulation…, but does not include a sexual
                  reassignment procedure or a medical procedure that has a genuine therapeutic purposes . <em>(Emphasis
                    added)</em></i></p>
              <p>The definition under the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act was more comprehensive since it
                covered all possible procedures likely to be used in carrying out FGM rather than limit it to the
                procedures that cut or remove as in the repealed Children Act.</p>
              <p>The Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act primarily criminalizes commission of FGM, regardless
                of whether or not done by a medical practitioner. In addition, where it allows the carrying out of
                surgical procedures necessary for an in individual physical or mental health, it eliminates culture,
                religion or a person’s customs as part of the considerations .</p>
              <p>In addition, the Act negates the use of consent as a defence by a person who performs FGM on another
                person. This ensures survivors of the practice are not threatened into lying that they had consented to
                the act. This was a huge boon considering that FGM is usually conducted on girls between the age of 8
                and 13 in several practicing communities.</p>
              <p>The Act casts the net of culpability as wide as it can by roping in the aiders and abettors ; those who
                procure FGM outside the country ; those who possess the tools for performing FGM ; those who allow use
                of their premises for FGM and those who use derogatory language against persons who have not undergone
                FGM .</p>
              <p><b>The Children Act No 23 of 2022</b>, made reference to the broad definition of FGM set out by the
                Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act . It also lists FGM as one of the harmful cultural
                practices that children are subjected to and considers child victims of FGM as Children in Need of Care
                and Protection .</p>
              <b>Beyond these direct references to FGM, the Children Act 2022 broadly defines child abuse to include
                infliction of physical harm on a child as well as the failure to report abuse of a child. Since FGM
                amounts to physical harm, both the procurer and the parents could be found culpable under this clause as
                well . </b>
              <p>The practice of FGM also inevitably violates the right of the girls to education and the right to
                highest standard of health, by endangering their lives and placing them in a very vulnerable position
                where the risk of dropping out of school is high.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-6">THE JUDICIARY’S TAKE</h3>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n <b>S M G v R A M</b> , the minor admitted that she had procured
                the
                female genital mutilation by herself and without any knowledge by her parents, who in her own words had
                told her not to do it. She further claimed that she did it because her age mates had teased her that she
                would remain in unmarried if she did not. </p>

              <p> Both parents were arraigned in court for allegedly contravening Section 24 of the Prohibition of
                Female Genital Mutilation Act which criminalizes failure to report that FGM has been, is being done or
                is intends to be done to a person.
              </p>

              <p>The parents though convicted by the Magistrates Court were acquitted by the High Court pending an
                appeal for one reason. The magistrate had overstepped his mandate by un-procedurally recalling the
                victim to testify because he found the prosecution’s case inadequate to justify a conviction. The recall
                was particularly problematic because the prosecutor had an opportunity to cross-examine her but refused
                to take it and nor did the judge ask her any questions as she testified for the defence</p>

              <p>This case serves to highlight the fact that despite there being laws and systems in place some
                stakeholders still keep dropping the ball at the peril of innocent Kenyan girls and women. In this
                particular case the prosecution did not do its due diligence since the Magistrates felt the need to go
                out of his way to find evidence for a conviction.</p>
              <p>Secondly, in as much as laws exist to regulate society, they do not always work out as seen in this
                case. The victim claimed that she was motivated by peer pressure from her peers to procure the FGM. This
                goes to show just how interconnected the issue of FGM is connected to the cultural life of most people.
                It is this interconnectedness that necessitates use of more sensitization in practicing communities,
                hand in hand with the punitive provisions of the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act. This
                would ensure that prevention remains as the key strategy in the fight against FGM.</p>
              <p>In 2020, the law on FGM had another watershed moment through the judgement in <b>Tatu Kamau v Attorney
                  General & 2 others (Tatu Kamau Case)</b> . The crux of the matter were <b> Sections 2, 5, 19, 20 and
                  21 of the
                  Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act</b> that were alleged to be in contravention of
                <b>Articles 19,
                  27, 32 and 44 of the Constitution</b> by limiting the choices of women and their right to uphold and
                respect
                their culture; ethnic identity; religion; beliefs; and by extension amounted to discrimination between
                men and women.
              </p>
              <p>Therefore, discrimination was dismissed by the Court due to the differences in the nature of the
                operation and consequences between FGM and male circumcision. According to the expert witnesses, where
                male circumcision had minimal risks and health benefits such as reduced risk of transmission of HIV, FGM
                had numerous physical and psychological effects such as excessive blood loss, difficulties in child
                birth, depression, chronic anxiety and phobias. Hence the same considerations child not apply to both
                practices. The differentiation between the two was found not to amount to unfair discrimination. </p>
              <p>Secondly, on the issue of consent, the Court was empathetic that consent does not legalize an act that
                is illegal if the effect of the Act causes extensive harm to the person consenting and the society. In
                addition, the capacity of women to consent was put in doubt considering the cultural pressure and
                threats that women from FGM practicing communities face. The Court was satisfied that in view of the
                harm caused by the practice it was reasonable to limit the right to practice it in a fair and just
                society.</p>
              <p>Of note is that, the petitioners arguments were buttressed on consent. Therefore, even if the case was
                decided in favour of the petitioner, FGM practice on minors would still have remained an offense due to
                their lack of capacity to consent.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-6">STATISTICS</h3>
              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/fgm3.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <figcaption>Children</figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>According to an article by NTV Kenya- media house, the prevalence of FGM has dropped from 38% in 1998
                to 15% in 2022. This was as per a statistics carried out by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics
                (KNBS). There has been a clear and steady decline of the rate of Female Genital Mutilation over the
                years. According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (a body within the Kenya National Bureau of
                Statistics), in 2003, the rate of female circumcision was at 32%, 27% between the years of 2008-2009 and
                at 21% as of 2014. This statistics is in relation to mutilation against children and women between the
                ages of 15-49. </p>
              <p>In 2022, the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey established that the percentage of women who have been
                circumcised with their flesh being removed is at 70% (this being a drop from 87% in 2014) and 12% of
                women having been sewn (this having a rise from 9%). </p>
              <p>The twist to all this is that, according to the statistics by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics,
                the prevalence of Female Genital Mutilation increases with age. The statistics show that 9% of girls
                between the ages of 15-19 is the rate at which girls within that age bracket are circumcised yearly
                while that of women between the ages of 45-49 is at 23%. </p>
              <p>In simple terms what this statistics show is that, as much as Female Genital Mutilation is still being
                practiced within some of the communities in Kenya, there is still a significant drop. This has been
                aided by many institutions and organizations who convey the downside of FGM to these communities. Amref
                Health Africa (being one of these organizations) has helped various communities practicing FGM through
                the incorporation of Community- Centered Interventions and evidence generation. Amref Health Africa has
                been able to come up with a digital tracking tool to help keep track of girls who have come forth
                seeking aid to be protected from the traditional/ cultural based practice of them being circumcised.
                This tool helps track these girls' education, health as well as their socio-economic welfare. This
                applies subsequently until the girls' attain the age of 25. </p>

              <p>Female Genital Mutilation is a practice that needs to be controlled and managed especially for the very
                young girls of tender ages who have just started school and are not aware or rather do not understand
                the essence of this practice and since the girls within this age bracket tend to be the most vulnerable.
                Hence, the Sensitization of the "Horrors of Female Genital Mutilation" should be encouraged throughout
                Kenya, within all the communities and the continue education on this should be highly motivated and
                encouraged. The law is by the people and for the people and the people ought to abide by it. </p>
