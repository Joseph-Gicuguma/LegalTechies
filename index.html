              <h1 class="mb-5">THE KENYAN CHILDREN ACT 2022: A LESSON ON PROGRESSIVE CHILDREN RIGHTS IN AFRICA.</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he Kenyan Legal system had a watershed moment in terms of Children
                Rights on 6th July 2022 when the President assented to the Children Act 2022. The Act is very
                progressive and covers the major developments in Children Rights in the last 21 years since the
                commencement of the previous Children Act. The Act particularly captures emerging trends in Children
                Rights; broadly defines offenses against children and provide clear guidelines for dealing with all
                children in general and others pertaining to children in conflict with the law and children in need of
                care and protection. I will only deal with some of the general provisions due to the word limit. </p>

              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/children.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <figcaption>Children</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <h3 class="mb-6">1.0 Provisions for All Children.</h3>
              <p>The drafters of the Act set the tempo for the entire Act with a very broad definition of Child Abuse.
                The Act sets out a non-exclusive list of ten examples which includes neglect and any attempt to persuade
                a child to take part in sexually explicit conduct whether online or offline. The Act also addresses
                Psychological Abuse separately and defines it as: </p>
              <p><i> the regular and deliberate use of a range of words and non-physical actions used with the purpose
                  to manipulate, hurt, weaken or frighten a person mentally and emotionally; and/or distort, confuse or
                  influence a person’s thoughts and actions within their everyday lives, changing their sense of self
                  and harming their wellbeing. </i></p>
              <p>This specifically addresses the mental health of children and is a welcome change considering that some
                mental conditions are borne out of experiences that people experience in their childhood, whether or not
                at the hands of caregivers or strangers and mental conditions have been prevalent among Kenyan youth in
                recent days . The Section also shows an appreciation of the fact that children are easily
                impressionable.</p>

              <p>In addition, a very generous definition of child trafficking is adopted, to encompass recruitment,
                transportation or transfer or receipt off a child for the purpose of f exploitation regardless of
                whether it is preceded by abduction or deception. </p>
              <p>Corporal punishment, which has been the result of litigation between parents and schools in some cases
                where it had resulted in fatal consequences, was liberally defined. It amounts to use of any physical
                force with intent to inflict pain or discomfort on a child for purposes of corrective discipline or
                punishment. This means that the weight of future arguments before the courts on reasonable use of
                physical force to discipline children has been incredibly watered down, and the consequences will cut
                across parents and teachers alike.</p>
                
                <figure class="my-4">
                  <img src="assets/img/child.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                  <figcaption>Children</figcaption>
                </figure>
              <p>The Act makes an attempt to actualize the freedom from discrimination embodied in Article 27(4),(5) and
                (6) of the Constitution while still acknowledging the need for differential treatment since children
                have varying needs. To this end, differential treatment is defined as preferential treatment accorded to
                children who are vulnerable or in a precarious social-economic situation. However, no differential
                treatment should limit the rights that a child has under the Act or under the Constitution. Any apparent
                discrimination against a child due to any status, that is not qualified as differential treatment is an
                offence that carries an imprisonment term of up to 12 months or two hundred thousand shillings fine or
                both. </p>
              <p>The Employment Act, allows for the employment of children between thirteen and sixteen for carrying out
                of light duties. The Children Act defines economic exploitation as unfairly taking advantage of another
                person due to their vulnerable by grossly underpaying them in comparison with market rates. This serves
                as a warning to all employers that children are not a source for cheap labor due to their perceived
                ignorance of the business trends.</p>
              <p>The Act introduced the concept of grooming, which it defines as the establishment of a relationship of
                trust or emotional connection with a child with the intention to establish a relationship that would
                lead to sexual contact or other child abuse that normalizes sexual behavior among or with children. This
                is aimed at curbing the child marriages in which some children from poor families are entrapped in, due
                to a misguided sense gratitude for their benefactors. </p>
              <p>In light of the recent recognition of the intersex persons’ as a third gender in Kenya during the
                previous census, the Act intends to give it legal effect. To that end the Act defines an intersex child
                as:</p>
              <p><i> a child with a congenital condition in which the biological sex characteristics cannot be
                  exclusively categorized in the common binary of female or male due to inherent and mixed anatomical,
                  hormonal, gonadal or chromosomal patterns, which could be apparent prior to, at birth, in childhood,
                  puberty or adulthood”.</i></p>
              <p>This is laudable because of its accuracy and broad framing, which ensures that at whichever point it
                becomes apparent that a person is intersex, then they are protected in law as such. The direction to the
                Principal Registrar to take measures to ensure correct documentation and registration of intersex
                children at birth is an added bonus. </p>
              <p>With the understanding that laws sometimes conflict, the Act arrogates itself as the superceding
                Statute in all matters relating to children unless the other provision of law offers a better benefit in
                law to the child. It further tasks any judicial or administrative institution to have regard to the best
                interests of the child while interpreting a conflict in laws. </p>
              <p>There Act resonates with Article 53(2) of the Constitution , to the effects that the best interests of
                the child are of first and Paramount importance and all public and private institutions should adhere to
                it in all matters regarding children. The preceding Act had not set out a criteria on what exactly
                amount to Best Interests of the Child, the current Act cured this by provided an open ended list
                consisting of 18 considerations. In addition, the Act creates an obligation for the expressed opinion of
                the child to be taken into account having regard to the age and level of maturity of the child.
              </p>
              <p>Finally, the Act sets the age of criminal liability at twelve years and further that children below the
                age of fourteen shall be presumed not to be capable of differentiating right from wrong. In addition to
                this, the Act out rightly prohibits the imposition of the Death Sentence on children.</p>

              <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he Children Act of 2022 has set in place an elaborate system to
                safeguard the rights of children. It clearly sets out the roles to be played by the National government
                through the Office of the Secretary of Children Services , the County Government, the Judiciary,
                parents, relatives of compared against the provisions of the Act children and institutions put in place
                by the Cabinet Secretary. The Act is further shielded from the retrogressive provisions of the Pre-2010
                Statutes through its supremacy clause. With this exquisite plan in place, all eyes are on the
                stakeholders to see how compliant there actions will be with the provisions of the Act </p>
